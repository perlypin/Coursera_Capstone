## New York City Restaurant Analysis

This project analyzes restaurants located in New York City neighbourhoods to find the best location for a new restaurant.  

Location data, user reviews and ratings were used to cluster similar restaurants.  


### Setup
Create a directory for the project  
`mkdir ny_analysis`

Download the notebook file, `New York City Restaurant Analysis.ipynb`, and move it to `ny_analysis`    

Cd into the directory  
`cd ny_analysis`  

A virtual environment can be created to keep all the required packages from conflicting with other versions of the packages that may be installed on the system. For example, using pip:  
`virtualenv venv`  
`source venv/bin/activate`

Install required packages using pip or conda  
`pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`

If installed, start jupyter notebook in a web browser  
`jupyter notebook`

Once jupyter is launched in a web browser, click on <name of file> to run the notebook.  

If jupyter is not installed, it can be installed using pip  
`pip install jupyter`

Other required packages for the project are installed from within the notebook.
